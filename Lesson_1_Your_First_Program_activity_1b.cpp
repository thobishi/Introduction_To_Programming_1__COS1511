/*
    If you have an analysing mind (and you need to develop your analytical skills to be a good programmer!) you
    should have been somewhat uncomfortable with having been told to type in all these strange instructions
    without any explanation. You should have been asking yourself what the various parts of the program mean
    and what they do.
    In your study notebook write down a number of questions about the code. Here is an example: it Must the
    code all be on three lines? In other words, canâ€™t I space things out a bit to make things more readable?
    Questions:
    1- What does '#include <iostream>' do?
    2- What is 'using namespace' ?
    3- What is 'int main()' ?
    4- What 'cout' stand for?
    5- What is the 'return 0' do?

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello, World";
    return 0;
