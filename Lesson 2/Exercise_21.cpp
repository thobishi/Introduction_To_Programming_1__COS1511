    Exercise 2.1
    ------------------------
    Add round brackets to the following C++ expressions to show the order in which the operators will be
    evaluated:
        (i) (80 / 5) + (70 / 6) = 27
        (ii) (-5 + -4) - (-3) = -6
        (iii) ((6 * 7) / 8) * 9 = 45
        (iv) 1 - (2 + (3 / (4 * 5))) = -1
        (v) (-1 + (23 / -4)) + 56 = 50
    Also give the value of each of the expressions.
